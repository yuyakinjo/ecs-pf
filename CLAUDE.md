# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AWS ECS-RDS Port Forwarding CLI (`ecs-pf`) - A TypeScript CLI tool that enables secure connections to RDS databases through AWS ECS tasks using SSM Session Manager. The tool provides interactive prompts for ease of use and supports ECS exec functionality.

## Development Commands

### Build & Run
```bash
# Build the project (regenerates src/version.ts, then bundles via decopin)
npm run build

# Run the CLI commands locally after building
npm run connect      # Port forwarding to RDS
npm run exec         # Execute commands in ECS containers
npm run enable-exec  # Enable ECS exec on services
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests (type-check + build + unit + integration)
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage     # Run with coverage report

# Type checking only (no build)
npm run type-check
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# oxc - oxfmt (formatter) + oxlint (linter)
npm run check          # Format and lint (with fixes)
npm run check:dry      # Check without applying fixes
npm run format         # Format only
npm run lint           # Lint only
npm run ci             # Run all checks in CI mode
```

### Release
```bash
# Print the version this moment would produce (CalVer YYYY.MMdd.HHmm, UTC)
bun run version:next

# Preview the GitHub Release body for that version
bun run release-notes 2026.914.1830
```

Releases are manual only: run the **release** workflow from the GitHub Actions tab
(tick `dry-run` to preview). There is no version input -- the number comes from the
clock. Never bump the version by hand. See `docs/RELEASE.md`.

## Architecture

### Core Flow
1. **CLI Entry** (`src/cli.ts`) - Commander-based CLI with three commands: `connect`, `exec`, `enable-exec`
2. **Interactive UI** (`src/core/ui-flows/`) - Inquirer-based prompts for resource selection
3. **AWS Integration** (`src/utils/`) - AWS SDK v3 clients for EC2, ECS, RDS, SSM
4. **Connection Logic** (`src/core/connection-flows/`) - Handles port forwarding setup
5. **Inference Engine** (`src/inference/`) - Smart scoring system for ECS cluster/task selection based on VPC/subnet matching

### Key Components

- **Type Safety**: Uses Valibot for runtime validation with schemas in `src/types/`
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom error types in `src/utils/errors.ts`
- **Testing**: Comprehensive mocks for AWS SDK clients in `test/mocks/`
- **Smart Selection**: Fuzzy search with Fuse.js and inference scoring for better UX

### Directory Structure
- `src/programs/` - Command implementations (connect, exec, enable-exec)
- `src/core/` - Business logic for connections and UI flows
- `src/inference/` - Scoring algorithms for intelligent resource selection
- `src/utils/` - Shared utilities (AWS clients, validation, formatting)
- `test/` - Test suites with mocks and fixtures

## Important Considerations

- **Runtime**: Project uses Bun 1.4.2 (managed by mise)
- **Module System**: ESM modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **Build Process**: `bun run generate-version` writes `src/version.ts` from package.json, then `decopin build` bundles `app/` into `dist/index.js`
- **AWS Permissions**: Requires proper IAM permissions for ECS, RDS, EC2, and SSM
- **Dependencies**: AWS SDK v3, decopin-cli for CLI/prompts, Chalk for output formatting
- **Lint/Format**: oxlint (`.oxlintrc.json`) and oxfmt (`.oxfmtrc.json`); Prettier only handles Markdown/YAML
- **Versioning**: CalVer `YYYY.MMdd.HHmm` (UTC), set by the release workflow. `src/version.ts` is generated -- never edit it. No CHANGELOG.md; history lives in GitHub Releases
- **Publishing**: npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) from `release.yml` only. No `NPM_TOKEN`
